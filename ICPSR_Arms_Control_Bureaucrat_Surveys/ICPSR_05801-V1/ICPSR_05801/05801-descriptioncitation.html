		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This study contains data from interviews with members 
 of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) 
 on their attitudes towards arms deployment and arms control by 
 the United States, as well as biographical and professional 
 background information. Respondents were asked questions about 
 their commitment to and intellectual interest in arms control, 
 the importance of arms control as a foreign policy issue, basic 
 orientation to arms control, and the effects of their job 
 position on their attitude towards arms control. Also elicited
 were respondents' perceptions of the influence of the ACDA,
 Department of State, Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other 
 influences over policy. Respondents were queried about their 
 reaction to the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) I 
 agreement, their preference for SALT II, the Comprehensive Test 
 Ban Treaty, and expenditures for strategic nuclear weapons. 
 Demographic variables include age, education, and job rank. In
 addition, biographical information is provided for other members
of the ACDA who were not interviewed.</span></p>
