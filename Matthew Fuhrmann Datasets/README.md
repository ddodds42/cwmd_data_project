### From [Matthew Fuhrmann's data site](http://www.matthewfuhrmann.com/datasets.html):

### The Nuclear Latency (NL) Dataset provides information on the global diffusion of latent nuclear capabilities from 1939 to 2012. It identifies all known uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing facilities that have been built globally during the nuclear age.

### The Foreign Nuclear Deployment (FND) Dataset contains information on foreign nuclear deployments from 1945 to 2000. Drawing on declassified documents, it identifies more than 20 cases in which states stationed nuclear forces on the territory of another country. 

### The Targeting Nuclear Programs (TNP) Dataset identifies cases in which countries considered using military force to delay their adversaries' nuclear programs. It covers the period from 1941 to 2000.

### The Nuclear Cooperation Agreement (NCA) Dataset contains information on nuclear cooperation agreements signed by countries from 1945 to 2003.  It includes more than 1,500 treaties in which states pledged to transfer nuclear technology, materials, or know-how. The dataset is based on the 2003 version of James Keeley's list of nuclear cooperation agreements.
