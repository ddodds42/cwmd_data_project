Super Simplistic Probability models so far.

Revisions to consider:
- Add more near miss events!
- Add this event: [NATO exercise in 1983 sparked Soviet fears of nuke strike](https://www.spacewar.com/reports/NATO_exercise_in_1983_sparked_Soviet_fears_of_nuke_strike_999.html)
- Adjust deterrance to not begin until USSR has delivery systems. Tsar Bomba? Cuban Missile Crisis? Other date?
- Use fault tree model to adjust the probabilities
- Sources from [medium article](https://medium.com/dataseries/likelihood-of-nuclear-war-we-have-no-idea-fb38d812912d) on % chance of nuclear war, adapt based on insights
- Jellybean survey
- Go bayesian
