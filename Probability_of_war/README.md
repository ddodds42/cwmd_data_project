Super Simplistic Probability models so far.

Revisions to consider:
- Add more near miss events!
- Adjust deterrance to not begin until USSR has delivery systems. Tsar Bomba? Cuban Missile Crisis? Other date?
- Use fault tree model to adjust the probabilities
- Sources from medium article on % chance of nuclear war, adapt based on insights
- Jellybean survey
- Go bayesian
