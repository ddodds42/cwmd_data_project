	'Description':"1945, WORLD WAR II. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were primarily justified as being necessary to avoid U.S. invasion of Japan (Operation Downfall), which was expected to be much deadlier than the bombings. However, some scholars propose that Japan’s surrender was induced not by the bombings, but instead by the Soviet Union’s declaration of war on Japan (e.g., Wilson 2013). Another alleged motivation for the bombings is American desire to establish post-war superiority over the Soviet Union. Depending on the considered event, prolongation could be considered level 1 (Operation Centerboard), 2 (Trinity test to deployent), 4 (Manhattan Project duration, or entrance of US into the Pacific Theater), 5 (the beginning of World War 2 in Europe), or 6 (the beginning of escalatory atrocities in Germany and/or Japanese occupied China)"

	'Description':"1969, THE SINO-SOVIET BORDER CONFLICT. The conflict occurred in two areas: first on the eastern border, along the Ussuri River north of North Korea, especially Zhenbao Island, and later on the western border, in the mountains north of the Himalaya. Total casualties were not much over 100. Nuclear threats were made by both sides, with the Soviets going as far as to instruct their embassy in Washington to gauge how the U.S. would react to a Soviet nuclear attack (Kuisong 2000, p.31-34). The Sino-Soviet border conflict was a seven-month undeclared military conflict between the Soviet Union and China in 1969, following the Sino-Soviet split. The most serious border clash, which brought the world's two largest communist states to the brink of war, occurred in March 1969 near Zhenbao (Damansky) Island on the Ussuri (Wusuli) River, near Manchuria. The conflict resulted in a ceasefire, which led to a return to the status quo."

The Soviet Union dispatched a flotilla that included what was probably a nuclear-powered submarine to confront the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the Bay of Bengal and to prevent the U.S. from intervening in the conflict between India and Pakistan over what is now Bangladesh (Kruglyakov 1975). Later reports that the Soviet submarine was armed with nuclear weapons seem to be the result of confusion about the meaning of the term “nuclear submarine”. On 6 and 13 December, the Soviet Navy dispatched two groups of cruisers and destroyers from Vladivostok;[131] they trailed US Task Force 74 into the Indian Ocean from 18 December 1971 until 7 January 1972. The Soviets also had a nuclear submarine to help ward off the threat posed by the USS Enterprise task force in the Indian Ocean.[142][143]"

After the war, there were reports that Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir authorized the assembly of 13 20-kiloton tactical nuclear weapons for use against Syrian and Egyptian targets, possibly in order to get the U.S. to take action on Israel’s behalf (Hersh 1993). More recent eyewitness testimony claims that Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan proposed to demonstrate Israel’s nuclear weapons capability on an unoccupied site, but that Meir rejected Dayan’s plan (Cohen 2013). Testing activity inferred based on France's spike in testing in the months before Oct. 1973, after Anwar Sadat threatened attack on Isreal and increased military exercises. Isreal was supplied materials and testing support from France."

The British War Cabinet considered removing the weapons from the carriers, but decided removing them would delay the deployment of the task force too long. After the UK lost several ships in combat, it decided to return the depth charges to England. The New Statesman alleged in 1984 that classified government telegrams showed that the U.K. also deployed a nucleararmed submarine to the South Atlantic and was considering a “threatened or demonstration nuclear attack” on the city of Córdoba. The existence of these telegrams has never been independently confirmed (Freedman 2005, pp. 48-50)."

South African President F.W de Klerk later said that if South Africa was attacked, it planned to detonate a bomb as a demonstration of its capability, and threatened to use a bomb unless the U.S. intervened on its behalf (Pabian 1995, Liberman 2001)."

Russia made nuclear threats, like Vladimir Putin’s March 2015 statement that Russia was ready to put nuclear weapons on alert in order to protect its “historic territory” in Crimea (MacFarquhar 2015). There has been general concern that the crisis could lead to NATO-Russia nuclear war (e.g., Berls and Ratz 2015). Depending on one’s perspective, this incident could be classified as a Russia-Ukraine direct war, a NATO-Russia crisis, or potentially in other ways as well."

Iranian military efforts and American diplomatic pressure eventually prompted the Soviet Union to leave. After the crisis—in 1952 —US President Harry Truman claimed that he compelled Joseph Stalin to withdraw Soviet troops from Iranian Azerbaijan by issuing an “ultimatum” involving a threat to use nuclear weapons (Mueller 1988). However, while the U.S. did send the Soviet Union a note calling for its withdrawal, research on the incident did not identify any evidence that Truman ever issued an ultimatum, much less threatened nuclear force (Thorpe 1978)."

Then in 1951, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff drafted an order authorizing the use of nuclear weapons in Manchuria if the Chinese launched airstrikes from there against U.S. forces in Korea (James 1985, p. 591) and the U.S. began sending B-29 bombers on nuclear attack training runs over North Korea.

The move was apparently intended to signal to Moscow that Nixon was unstable in hopes that this would motivate Moscow to act in ways that Washington considered more favorable. Exactly which Soviet actions were targeted is a matter of debate. Some observers have proposed that Nixon did this to signal opposition to the Soviet proposal to attack China with nuclear weapons in the Sino-Soviet border conflict, which was ongoing at the time. However, Sagan and Suri (2003) argue that Nixon was not focused on the Sino-Soviet border conflict, and instead acted in hopes of ending the Vietnam war in favorable terms."

In response, the U.S. raised its alert status to DefCon 3. The U.S. had no intent to use nuclear weapons. Instead, the intent was to deter the Soviet threat. Additionally, only one minor incident of inadvertent escalation during this episode has been identified, which was quickly resolved (Sagan 1993, p.212-216). The United States’ incorrect belief that Soviet nuclear warheads were being transported to Egypt helped spark a U.S. nuclear alert, which may, in turn, have prompted the start of a Soviet alert."

The crisis was fought principally between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China, with the PRC attacking ROC-held islands near mainland China. The U.S. quickly moved in defense of the ROC. In September 1954, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Arthur Radford recommended nuclear weapons be used if PRC’s attack intensified, on grounds that the conflict was an important fight in the war against communism. In March 1954, U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles also spoke of potential nuclear weapons use, “to make up for deficiency in conventional forces”. Soon after, President Eisenhower said he saw no reason why smaller tactical nuclear weapons “shouldn’t be used just exactly as you would use a bullet or anything else”. Conventional and nuclear war plans were made, and war seemed imminent until April 1954, when PRC leadership abruptly committed to negotiating a ceasefire with the U.S. Whether the U.S. would have used nuclear weapons if the conflict continued remains unclear (Chang 1988)."

Kennedy considered a first strike against the Soviet Union. The Joint Chiefs of Staff had concluded that it would be impossible to defend West Berlin with just conventional weapons. Recent intelligence had shown that, contrary to what had widely been believed, the U.S. nuclear arsenal was much larger than the Soviet Union’s. A group of White House and Pentagon officials produced a detailed plan to destroy the Soviet Union’s second-strike capability by attacking 1,077 “military and urban industrial targets” in the “Sino-Soviet Bloc”. Instead of launching an attack, Kennedy had Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell Gilpatric give a speech revealing how many nuclear weapons the U.S. had relative to the Soviet Union. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev responded by conducting a test of a thirty-megaton bomb, the most powerful weapon that had been tested at that time (Kaplan 2001)."

In April 2013, the North Korean army said it had “final approval” to launch nuclear attacks on the U.S. and said that war could break out “today or tomorrow (Boghani 2013). In February 2016, it threatened a “pre-emptive attack” that would turn both South Korea and the U.S. into a “sea of fire” if there were any attempt to overthrow the North Korean government (YNA 2016).
