	'Description':"1945, WORLD WAR II. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were primarily justified as being necessary to avoid U.S. invasion of Japan (Operation Downfall), which was expected to be much deadlier than the bombings. However, some scholars propose that Japan’s surrender was induced not by the bombings, but instead by the Soviet Union’s declaration of war on Japan (e.g., Wilson 2013). Another alleged motivation for the bombings is American desire to establish post-war superiority over the Soviet Union. Depending on the considered event, prolongation could be considered level 1 (Operation Centerboard), 2 (Trinity test to deployent), 4 (Manhattan Project duration, or entrance of US into the Pacific Theater), 5 (the beginning of World War 2 in Europe), or 6 (the beginning of escalatory atrocities in Germany and/or Japanese occupied China)"

The conflict occurred in two areas: first on the eastern border, along the Ussuri River north of North Korea, especially Zhenbao Island, and later on the western border, in the mountains north of the Himalaya. Total casualties were not much over 100. Nuclear threats were made by both sides, with the Soviets going as far as to instruct their embassy in Washington to gauge how the U.S. would react to a Soviet nuclear attack (Kuisong 2000, p.31-34). The Sino-Soviet border conflict was a seven-month undeclared military conflict between the Soviet Union and China in 1969, following the Sino-Soviet split. The most serious border clash, which brought the world's two largest communist states to the brink of war, occurred in March 1969 near Zhenbao (Damansky) Island on the Ussuri (Wusuli) River, near Manchuria. The conflict resulted in a ceasefire, which led to a return to the status quo."

The Soviet Union dispatched a flotilla that included what was probably a nuclear-powered submarine to confront the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the Bay of Bengal and to prevent the U.S. from intervening in the conflict between India and Pakistan over what is now Bangladesh (Kruglyakov 1975). Later reports that the Soviet submarine was armed with nuclear weapons seem to be the result of confusion about the meaning of the term “nuclear submarine”. On 6 and 13 December, the Soviet Navy dispatched two groups of cruisers and destroyers from Vladivostok;[131] they trailed US Task Force 74 into the Indian Ocean from 18 December 1971 until 7 January 1972. The Soviets also had a nuclear submarine to help ward off the threat posed by the USS Enterprise task force in the Indian Ocean.[142][143]"

After the UK lost several ships in combat, it decided to return the depth charges to England.

The move was apparently intended to signal to Moscow that Nixon was unstable in hopes that this would motivate Moscow to act in ways that Washington considered more favorable. Exactly which Soviet actions were targeted is a matter of debate. Some observers have proposed that Nixon did this to signal opposition to the Soviet proposal to attack China with nuclear weapons in the Sino-Soviet border conflict, which was ongoing at the time. However, Sagan and Suri (2003) argue that Nixon was not focused on the Sino-Soviet border conflict, and instead acted in hopes of ending the Vietnam war in favorable terms."

The U.S. quickly moved in defense of the ROC. In September 1954, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Arthur Radford recommended nuclear weapons be used if PRC’s attack intensified, on grounds that the conflict was an important fight in the war against communism. In March 1954, U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles also spoke of potential nuclear weapons use, “to make up for deficiency in conventional forces”. Soon after, President Eisenhower said he saw no reason why smaller tactical nuclear weapons “shouldn’t be used just exactly as you would use a bullet or anything else”. Conventional and nuclear war plans were made, and war seemed imminent until April 1954, when PRC leadership abruptly committed to negotiating a ceasefire with the U.S. Whether the U.S. would have used nuclear weapons if the conflict continued remains unclear (Chang 1988)."

Kennedy considered a first strike against the Soviet Union. The Joint Chiefs of Staff had concluded that it would be impossible to defend West Berlin with just conventional weapons. Recent intelligence had shown that, contrary to what had widely been believed, the U.S. nuclear arsenal was much larger than the Soviet Union’s. A group of White House and Pentagon officials produced a detailed plan to destroy the Soviet Union’s second-strike capability by attacking 1,077 “military and urban industrial targets” in the “Sino-Soviet Bloc”. Instead of launching an attack, Kennedy had Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell Gilpatric give a speech revealing how many nuclear weapons the U.S. had relative to the Soviet Union. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev responded by conducting a test of a thirty-megaton bomb, the most powerful weapon that had been tested at that time (Kaplan 2001)."

On or around 27 October,11 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the U.S. Navy tried to force the nuclear-armed Soviet submarine B-59 to surface near Cuba using low-yield practice depth charges. The B-59 had not been able to surface in order to communicate with Moscow for two days and was not sure whether hostilities between the U.S. and the Soviet Union had started. When the depth charges began to explode the submarine captain ordered his crew to prepare the submarine’s nuclear torpedo. Then, after consultation with his second captain and his political officer, the captain ordered the submarine to surface (Mozgovoi 2002). The second captain, Vassily Arkhipov, has been credited with having vetoed the decision to launch the torpedo over the objections of the two other officers (Lloyd 2002). Sources conflict on whether the submarine crew had the authority to launch the torpedo without direct orders from Moscow. The submarine’s communications officer later said in an interview that Arkhipov did play an important role in calming the captain down, but that while there was a danger of an accident or equipment malfunction, they were never close to intentionally launching the nuclear torpedo (Savranskaya 2007)."

The exercise occurred during a time of heightened tensions between NATO and the Soviet Union, with Soviet leadership fearing a U.S. first strike attack. Soviet intelligence monitored the exercise closely, trying to determine whether it might actually be the prelude to a real attack. Soviet forces made some responses, including moving leadership to a bunker and putting nuclear bomber planes on runway alert. Exactly how concerned the Soviets were and how close they were to launching their own attack is unclear and is a matter of ongoing inquiry (Manchanda 2009; Mastny 2009; Adamsky 2013)."

BMEWS passed on the warning to NORAD headquarters in Colorado. Because there was no other evidence of an attack—and because it seemed unlikely the Soviets would launch a first strike while Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was visiting the U.N. in New York—NORAD determined it was a false alarm caused by the new system (Schlosser 2013, pp. 253-54)."

They had not been informed about the passage of the satellite because the facility that should have informed them had been assigned to other tasks during the crisis. In addition, radar systems that could have been used to confirm the attack were not operating at the time (Sagan 1993, pp. 130-31)."

The rocket had flight characteristics similar to a submarine-launched ballistic missile intended for a high-altitude nuclear attack that could blind Russian radar with an electromagnetic pulse. Russian nuclear forces went on full alert and prepared to retaliate if the missile was the beginning of a larger attack. Russian President Boris Yeltsin said the next day that he had activated the nuclear weapons command suitcase used to authorize a nuclear launch. When Russian early warning satellites failed to detect any more launches, the incident was declared a false alarm. Indeed, the rocket was a scientific weather rocket. Norway had notified Russia of the launch in advance, but the information was not passed on to the radar technicians (Schlosser 2013, p. 478)."

On 2 November 1962, just after the Cuban missile crisis, the alert sounded. A U.S. C.I.A. officer following up on the alert was taken for interrogation by the K.G.B. Because the alert came after the crisis and because the K.G.B. was there, the U.S. concluded—correctly—that Penkovsky had been compromised and that the alert was a false alarm (Sagan 1993)."

U.S. missile crews were put on high alert and nuclear bombers prepared to take off. Because early warning radar and satellites showed no signs of an attack the threat assessment conference was terminated after six minutes and no action was taken. In a declassified memo, a State Department official said that “false alerts of this kind are not a rare occurrence” but that there is “complacency about handling them that disturbs me” (Shulman 1979; see also Sagan 1993)."

SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.” There was no inbound missile; instead, a HI-EMA employee had sent out the alert when he failed to hear the word “exercise” repeated at the beginning of a drill and mistook the drill for an actually missile warning (Berman and Fung 2018). Because HI-EMA didn’t have a message canceling a missile alert 31 prepared in advance, it took 38 minutes for the agency to send a text indicating the alert had been sent in error. Earlier reports noted that it would have been easy to accidentally select an actual alert instead of a system test from the user interface’s confusing dropdown of nearly identical alert options (Wang 2018)."

On November 24, 1961, U.S. Strategic Air Command (SAC) lost contact with Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) early warning radar in Thule, Greenland. When SAC tried to call NORAD headquarters the line was dead. The fact that both lines of communication down at the same time raised concerns that an attack was underway and SAC’s alert force was ordered to prepare for takeoff. The alert was called off after a U.S. bomber over Greenland was able to make contact with the radar facility. Subsequent investigation showed that a single AT&T switch at a microwave tower in Colorado had failed, which shut down communications between SAC and NORAD and communications with the early warning radar system. AT&T was supposed to build redundant circuits but had failed to do so (Schlosser 2013, p. 286)."
