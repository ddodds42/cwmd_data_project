	'Description':'1945, WORLD WAR II. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were primarily justified as being necessary to avoid U.S. invasion of Japan (Operation Downfall), which was expected to be much deadlier than the bombings. However, some scholars propose that Japan’s surrender was induced not by the bombings, but instead by the Soviet Union’s declaration of war on Japan (e.g., Wilson 2013). Another alleged motivation for the bombings is American desire to establish post-war superiority over the Soviet Union. Depending on the considered event, prolongation could be considered level 1 (Operation Centerboard), 2 (Trinity test to deployent), 4 (Manhattan Project duration, or entrance of US into the Pacific Theater), 5 (the beginning of World War 2 in Europe), or 6 (the beginning of escalatory atrocities in Germany and/or Japanese occupied China)'

	'Description':'1969, THE SINO-SOVIET BORDER CONFLICT. The conflict occurred in two areas: first on the eastern border, along the Ussuri River north of North Korea, especially Zhenbao Island, and later on the western border, in the mountains north of the Himalaya. Total casualties were not much over 100. Nuclear threats were made by both sides, with the Soviets going as far as to instruct their embassy in Washington to gauge how the U.S. would react to a Soviet nuclear attack (Kuisong 2000, p.31-34). The Sino-Soviet border conflict was a seven-month undeclared military conflict between the Soviet Union and China in 1969, following the Sino-Soviet split. The most serious border clash, which brought the world's two largest communist states to the brink of war, occurred in March 1969 near Zhenbao (Damansky) Island on the Ussuri (Wusuli) River, near Manchuria. The conflict resulted in a ceasefire, which led to a return to the status quo.'

	'Rating': '2.1.2', 'Dimensions':{1:[1,2], 2:[1], 3:[2]},
	'Description':'1971, INDO-PAKISTANI WAR. The Soviet Union dispatched a flotilla that included what was probably a nuclear-powered submarine to confront the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the Bay of Bengal and to prevent the U.S. from intervening in the conflict between India and Pakistan over what is now Bangladesh (Kruglyakov 1975). Later reports that the Soviet submarine was armed with nuclear weapons seem to be the result of confusion about the meaning of the term “nuclear submarine”. On 6 and 13 December, the Soviet Navy dispatched two groups of cruisers and destroyers from Vladivostok;[131] they trailed US Task Force 74 into the Indian Ocean from 18 December 1971 until 7 January 1972. The Soviets also had a nuclear submarine to help ward off the threat posed by the USS Enterprise task force in the Indian Ocean.[142][143]'

	'Description':'1973, THE “YOM KIPPUR” ARAB-ISRAELI WAR, ISRAELI ACTIONS. After the war, there were reports that Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir authorized the assembly of 13 20-kiloton tactical nuclear weapons for use against Syrian and Egyptian targets, possibly in order to get the U.S. to take action on Israel’s behalf (Hersh 1993). More recent eyewitness testimony claims that Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan proposed to demonstrate Israel’s nuclear weapons capability on an unoccupied site, but that Meir rejected Dayan’s plan (Cohen 2013). Testing activity inferred based on France's spike in testing in the months before Oct. 1973, after Anwar Sadat threatened attack on Isreal and increased military exercises. Isreal was supplied materials and testing support from France.'

	'Description':'1982, THE FALKLANDS WAR. In April 1982, the UK deployed two aircraft carriers armed with nuclear depth charges as part of the task force that engaged Argentina. The British War Cabinet considered removing the weapons from the carriers, but decided removing them would delay the deployment of the task force too long. After the UK lost several ships in combat, it decided to return the depth charges to England. The New Statesman alleged in 1984 that classified government telegrams showed that the U.K. also deployed a nucleararmed submarine to the South Atlantic and was considering a “threatened or demonstration nuclear attack” on the city of Córdoba. The existence of these telegrams has never been independently confirmed (Freedman 2005, pp. 48-50).'

Shortly after a ceasefire was signed, South Africa announced that it had the “capacity to make” a nuclear weapon and began to prepare its Kalahari test site for a nuclear test. South African President F.W de Klerk later said that if South Africa was attacked, it planned to detonate a bomb as a demonstration of its capability, and threatened to use a bomb unless the U.S. intervened on its behalf (Pabian 1995, Liberman 2001).'

Cheney said that he was not 23 seriously considering using nuclear weapons but was curious about the U.S. options. The study was destroyed after Cheney reviewed it (Schwartz 1998, p. 111).'

Pakistan moved its nuclear weapons from storage and Pakistan’s foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmad said that Pakistan would “not hesitate to use any weapon in its arsenal to protect its territorial integrity (Lewis et al. 2014). General Pervez Musharraf later wrote in his memoir that Pakistan’s nuclear delivery system was not in operation during the Kargil War (Musharraf 2006, p. 97).'

Ongoing tension between India and Pakistan worsened when 31 people were killed were killed by Pakistani militants in a terrorist attack near the town of Kaluchak. Pakistan responded to the increase in tensions by conducting a series of ballistic missile tests. Several Pakistani officials also reiterated warnings that Pakistan might use nuclear weapons if its existence were threatened (Nayak and Krepon 2006, p. 33-34).'

	'Description':'2013-2015, THE UKRAINIAN CIVIL WAR. The crisis and civil war that broke out in Ukraine in 2013 raised fears of nuclear war with Russia that had been largely dormant since the end of the Cold War. Russia made nuclear threats, like Vladimir Putin’s March 2015 statement that Russia was ready to put nuclear weapons on alert in order to protect its “historic territory” in Crimea (MacFarquhar 2015). There has been general concern that the crisis could lead to NATO-Russia nuclear war (e.g., Berls and Ratz 2015). Depending on one’s perspective, this incident could be classified as a Russia-Ukraine direct war, a NATO-Russia crisis, or potentially in other ways as well.'

	'Description':'1946, AZERBAIJAN CRISIS. Allied forces invaded and occupied Iran during WWII. After the war, the Soviet Union initially refused to leave. Iranian military efforts and American diplomatic pressure eventually prompted the Soviet Union to leave. After the crisis—in 1952 —US President Harry Truman claimed that he compelled Joseph Stalin to withdraw Soviet troops from Iranian Azerbaijan by issuing an “ultimatum” involving a threat to use nuclear weapons (Mueller 1988). However, while the U.S. did send the Soviet Union a note calling for its withdrawal, research on the incident did not identify any evidence that Truman ever issued an ultimatum, much less threatened nuclear force (Thorpe 1978).'

In November 1950, after China joined the war, U.S. President Harry Truman told reporters the U.S. would consider using “every weapon that we have” against Chinese forces, including the atomic bomb. Then in 1951, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff drafted an order authorizing the use of nuclear weapons in Manchuria if the Chinese launched airstrikes from there against U.S. forces in Korea (James 1985, p. 591) and the U.S. began sending B-29 bombers on nuclear attack training runs over North Korea. Although the U.S. signaled its willingness to use nuclear weapons, it never deployed any bombs for use in Korea (Dingman 1988).'

	'Description':'1954, THE FIRST INDOCHINA WAR. In 1954, towards the end of the war, French soldiers were trapped at Điện Biên Phủ in northwestern Vietnam. The U.S. military was helping them. For this effort, the U.S. considered using nuclear weapons as part of a plan known as Operation Vulture. The threat was sufficiently serious that the French expected that the U.S. would use nuclear weapons (Grant 2004), though ultimately the U.S. decided against it.'
